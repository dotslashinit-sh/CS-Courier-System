# Courier Service System

## Introduction
A simple MySQL powered Courier Service system written in python. There are way too much improvements that could be done in this program. If it looks dirty, its probably because I can't concern myself with keeping this one clean and with the features of the latest python versions. I'll definitely fix it all up when I get the time.

## How-To-Run
 - Install Python (> 3.5).
 - Install MySQL 8.0 Community Edition with Connector/Python component enabled.
 - Configure the root user to use the password `root` or better, change the secrets in the code to your password.
 - Create a database named `courier`
